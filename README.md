 # **Real Estate Price Prediction**

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict real estate prices using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. The model utilizes Python, with Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization, and Scikit-learn for linear regression. Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier removal, and model evaluation using k-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV.

Technologies Used
Python for programming.
Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib for visualization.
Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis.
