# **Real Estate Price Prediction**
This project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to building a machine learning model for predicting real estate prices based on historical data from the Bangalore housing market. The model is built using Python, Scikit-learn, and linear regression, with the dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## **Project Overview**
In this project, we aim to predict the prices of homes based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location. The project follows a comprehensive data science workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation using techniques like cross-validation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: Bangalore Home Prices Dataset.

The dataset includes the following columns:

Area (location)

Square Footage (sqft)

Number of Bedrooms (BHK)

Number of Bathrooms

Price

## Technologies and Tools
The following technologies and libraries are used for building the model and conducting the data analysis:

Python: Programming language used for all tasks.

Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and model building.

Numpy and Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn (Sklearn): For model building (Linear Regression) and performance evaluation.
